## Packages

## Notes
- Task completions use `date: "plan"` for permanent plan tasks, and `date: "YYYY-MM-DD"` for daily recurring tasks so they reset each day.
- English and Turkish translations are handled via a local React Context (`LanguageContext`).
- Dark mode is enabled by default via Tailwind `dark` class on html/body in App layout.
